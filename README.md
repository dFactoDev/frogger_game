# FROGGER GAME
## Aim of the Game
The aim is to get to the water with as many points as possible and continue trying to beat your last highest score.
The more you dodge the bugs, the more points you get.
Picking up treasures will get you bonus points.

## How to play
You start off on the grass, with paving between you and the water.
Use the arrow keys to jump around.
Bugs crawl along the paving. If you hit a bug, the game resets.

If you jump in the water, the game ends and if the total points scored are the highest yet, you'll get a new highscore.

See how high you can get the highscore!

## Scoring
Each jump on the __paving__ area gets you _50_ points.
Each jump back on the __grass__ subtracts _50_ points.

### Bonus Points
There are three treasures (gems) which appear from time to time.
Picking up a gem gets you bonus points as follows:
* __Green__ Gem - adds _25%_ of your current score.
* __Blue__ Gem - adds _50%_ of your current score.
* __Orange__ Gem - _doubles_ your current score.

## It gets harder
As you continue playing, the game gets harder!

Every time you have picked up three gems, the bugs will get faster.
A bug gets added to the game, when the current score goes above 80 000 and again when the score goes above 200 000.

Good luck!
