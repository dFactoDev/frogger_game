# FROGGER GAME
## Aim of the Game
The aim is to get to the water with as many points as possible 
and continue trying to beat your last highest score.
The more you dodge the bugs, the more points you get. 
Picking up treasures will get you bonus points.

## How to play
You start off on the grass, with paving between you and the water.
Use the arrow keys to jump around.
Bugs crawl along the paving. If you hit a bug, the game resets.

If you jump in the water, the game ends and if the total points 
scored are the highest yet, you'll get a new highscore.

See how high you can get the highscore!

## Scoring
Each jump on the paving area gets you 50 points.
Each jump back on the grass subtracts 50 points.

### Bonus Points
There are three treasures (gems) which appear from time to time.
Picking up a gem gets you bonus points as follows:
######Green Gem - adds 25% of your current score.
######Blue Gem - adds 50% of your current score.
######Orange Gem - doubles your current score.

## It gets harder
As you continue playing, the game gets harder!

Every time you have picked up three gems, the bugs will get faster.
A bug gets added to the game, when the current score goes above 80 000
and again when the score goes above 200 000.

Good luck!
